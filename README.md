#goIRC
##A lightweight IRC client written in Go

I'm teaching myself Go, and I want to write something interesting and useful to figure out what I can do with it. That's why goIRC exists.

I plan on adding features like an interactive ncurses-type UI and themes, but for now it's completely bare-bones.
